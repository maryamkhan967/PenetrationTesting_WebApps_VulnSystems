# 🔐 Penetration Testing of Web Applications and Vulnerable Systems

## 📝 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing penetration testing (PT) on multiple intentionally vulnerable systems to simulate real-world attacks and evaluate application and system security. The main goal is to identify and exploit common vulnerabilities in web applications and Android environments using ethical hacking tools and techniques.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn and apply different penetration testing methodologies.
- Discover, exploit, and document vulnerabilities in web applications and Android apps.
- Gain hands-on experience with widely used offensive security tools.
- Understand how to recommend proper security countermeasures.


## 💻 Target Machines
- **Metasploitable 2** – vulnerable Linux machine for testing OS and network-level vulnerabilities.
- **bWAPP (Buggy Web Application)** – insecure web app with 100+ vulnerabilities.
- **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App)** – PHP/MySQL-based web app for learning web vulnerabilities.
- **DIVA (Damn Insecure and Vulnerable App)** – Android-based mobile application for testing mobile vulnerabilities.


## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Kali Linux** (Attacker machine)
- **Metasploit Framework**
- **Nmap**
- **Burp Suite**
- **Hydra**
- **Nikto**
- **adb (Android Debug Bridge)** – for analyzing Android apps
- **Drozer** – Android security testing framework


## 🧠 Learnings & Skills Gained
- Improved understanding of web app architecture and attack surface
- Practical knowledge of tools like Burp Suite, Metasploit, and Drozer
- Gained experience in analyzing and exploiting Android applications
- Built habit of responsible disclosure and ethical hacking practices
